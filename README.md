RevNotes is an app designed to get the most out of book reviews by encouraging users to keep their reviews to 700 characters each. The idea is that confining one's thoughts to a medium of brevity will produce more thoughtful, careful reviews. In addition, people can read these reviews quickly, while waiting in line, for instance.

Users can:
- create a user account
- log in and out
- conduct a search of the Google Books API and receive multiple results
- write 700 character (max) reviews on the books they've read
- see all the reviews they've written on their user page
- see all the reviews submitted by all users on the community page


Future functionality:
- delete/edit posts
- comments/discussion boards
- review searching
